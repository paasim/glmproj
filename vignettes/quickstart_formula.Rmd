This vignette shows how to use the main functionalities of the ```projpred```-package, which implements the projective variable selection (Piironen et al., 2018) for (hierarchical) generalized linear models. The package is compatible with many models in ```rstanarm``` and ```brms``` but also other reference models could be used (see section Custom reference models). The main methods implemented in the package are described in Piironen et al. (2018). Performance for generalized linear models in comparison to many other methods is evaluated in Piironen and Vehtari (2017a).

The difference with respect to the standard quickstart guide is that in this vignette we are using a more general API that works with `formula` instances, so that the inner implementation does not depend on any specific structure.


## Gaussian example
Load the necessary packages. If the sampling takes more than 10 seconds and multiple cores are available, uncomment the line setting `mc.cores` to set the number of cores used (this is commented out as the sampling in the example is fast and to avoid possible problems when building the vignette along the package installation in special environments such as computing clusters).
```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(rstanarm)
library(projpred)
library(ggplot2)
library(bayesplot)
theme_set(theme_classic())
#options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
devtools::load_all()
```

The package contains a simple Gaussian example dataset accessible with the `data`-command. This dataset is one of the example cases from the `glmnet`-package. The following loads a dataframe `df_gaussian` with the predictor matrix `x` and the corresponding targets `y` into the workspace.
```{r}
data('df_gaussian', package = 'projpred')
```

We first construct a model with all the variables and regularized horseshoe prior (Piironen and Vehtari, 2017c) on the regression coefficients. This gives us the full Bayesian solution to the problem. We specify the prior on the number of relevant variables using the approch by Piironen and Vehtari (2017b,c). The prior for the global shrinkage parameter is defined based on the prior on the number of relevant variables.
```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
split_structure <- break_up_matrix_term(y ~ x, data=df_gaussian)
df_gaussian <- split_structure$data
formula <- split_structure$formula
d <- df_gaussian
n <- nrow(df_gaussian) # 100
D <- ncol(df_gaussian[, -1]) # 20
p0 <- 5 # prior guess for the number of relevant variables
tau0 <- p0/(D-p0) * 1/sqrt(n) # scale for tau (notice that stan_glm will automatically scale this by sigma)
fit <- brm(formula, family=gaussian(), data=df_gaussian,
           prior=prior(horseshoe(scale_global = tau0, scale_slab = 1), class=b),
           ## To make this vignette build fast, we use only 2 chains and
           ## 500 iterations. In practice, at least 4 chains should be 
           ## used and 2000 iterations might be required for reliable
           ## inference.
           seed=1, chains=2, iter=500)
```

In order to have a very general interface to `projpred` we need to specify some functions. These are:
  - Maximum likelihood estimator for the projections.
  - Prediction function for each of the submodels.
  - Prediction function for the reference model.
  - Function to fetch data from the original dataset, given that we are using cross validation to determine the solution path.

For most models these will be quite simple functions interfacing with other packages, as shown next.

```{r, results='hide', messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
predfun <- function(fit, newdata=NULL)
  t(posterior_linpred(fit, newdata = newdata))

proj_predfun <- function(fit, newdata=NULL) {
  newdata <- as.data.frame(fetch_data(xnew=newdata))
  predict(fit, newdata = newdata)
}

mle <- function(form, dat)
  lm(form, data = dat)

fetch_data <- function(obs=NULL, xnew=NULL) {
  if (is.null(obs))
    if (is.null(xnew))
      return(d)
    else
      return(xnew)
  else if (is.null(xnew))
    return(d[obs, ])
  else
    return(xnew[obs, ])
}
```

The first function, `predfun`, is the prediction function for the reference model, so we use `posterior_linpred` from `rstanarm`.
For each of the submodels we use `proj_predfun`, which uses `lme4` `predict` function for linear models.
To fit the projections we use `lm`.
Finally, the `fetch_data` function that simply extracts a set of data points from the dataset, that will be used during the cross validation stage.
The `fetch_data` function needs to handle the different data structures needed in different contexts inside `projpred`.

Next we construct the reference model structure `refmodel`.

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, messages=FALSE}
refmodel <- get_refmodel(fit)
```

Before building the `refmodel `structure we call `break_up_matrix_term`.
This is a convenience function to automatically split matrix variables in linear terms. For example, in `y ~ x`, `x` can be a matrix.
If this function is not used, `projpred` considers `x` to be jointly included or excluded in the variable selection.

The function `cv_varsel_poc` runs the variable selection, and returns an object that contains the relevant information about the variable selection, such as the ordering of the variables. The search heuristic can be specified by the keyword `method`.
Although it is theoretically possible to use L1-search for this linear model, it has not been implemented for the general `formula` interface, and we will use the `forward` method.

```{r, results='hide', messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
vs <- cv_varsel(refmodel, method='forward')
```

```{r, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
vs$vind # selection order of the variables
```

We plot some statistics computed on the training data, such as the sum of log predictive densities (ELPD) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as the function of number of variables added. By default, the statistics are shown on absolute scale, but with ```deltas=T``` the plot shows results relative to the full model.
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
# plot predictive performance on training data
varsel_plot(vs, stats=c('elpd', 'rmse'))
```

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
# plot the validation results, this time relative to the full model
varsel_plot(vs, stats = c('elpd', 'rmse'), deltas=T)
```

We perform the projection for a submodel of desired size using the function `project`. The projection can also be coerced to a matrix with draws of the selected variables and sigma. The draws can be visualized with, for example, the `mcmc_areas` function in the `bayesplot` package. Below we compare how the projection affects the three most relevant variables.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=2}
 # Visualise the three most relevant variables in the full model -->
 mcmc_areas(as.matrix(refmodel$fit),
            pars = c('(Intercept)', unlist(vs$vind[1:3]), 'sigma')) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-2, 2))
```

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=2}
# Visualise the projected three most relevant variables
proj <- project(vs, nv = 3, ns = 500)
mcmc_areas(t(as.matrix(proj$sub_fit$coefficients))) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-2, 2))
```

We make predictions with the projected submodels. For point estimates we can use method `proj_linpred`. Test inputs can be provided using the keyword `xnew`. If also the test targets `ynew` are provided, then the function evaluates the log predictive density at these points. For instance, the following computes the mean of the predictive distribution and evaluates the log density at the training points using the 6 most relevant variables.
```{r}
xnew <- df_gaussian[, colnames(df_gaussian) != "y"]
pred <- proj_linpred(vs, xnew=xnew, ynew=df_gaussian$y, nv = 6, integrated = TRUE)
```

Visualize the predictions
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=pred$pred,y=df_gaussian$y)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, color='red') +
  labs(x = 'prediction', y = 'y')
```

We also obtain draws from the projected predictive distribution. Here's an example prediction for the first data point using 6 variables (the observed value is marked by the red line)
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
xnew <- df_gaussian[, colnames(df_gaussian) != "y"]
y1_rep <- proj_predict(vs, xnew=xnew[1,,drop=F], nv=6, seed=7560)
qplot(as.vector(y1_rep), bins=25) +
geom_vline(xintercept = df_gaussian$y[1], color='red') +
xlab('y1_rep')
```
